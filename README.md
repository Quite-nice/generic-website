Generic website generator

This repo doesn't do anything just yet, but it should:

given a `JSON` object like the one below...:
```json
{
  "title": "Franzjipan",
  "domain": "franzjipan.be",
  "subtitle": "top notch bakery",
  "theme": "this could be anything",
  "references": {
    "jeroen": "url or logo",
    "kymer": "url or logo",
    "damiaan": "url or logo"
  }
  ...
}
```

> Please note that this `JSON` object is a mere example and could be something completely different once finished.

... should create a generic, static, portfolio type website. Why? because I need one and I much rather fiddle around in javascript than any other website generator or god forbid, HTML + CSS...
